# Introducion

In this section we will introduce example of each available layer of Geovisto with working example.  
Layers represent forms of thematic geographical maps. Most commonly used example of this is choropleth map[^1]
or heat map[^2].  
  
Each layer described in this tutorial has short how-to-use guide, if needed.
