# Playground

On our site, you can try Playground, which consists of the implemented Geovisto library, three library inputs - geographic data, measured data and configuration. We've prepared sample data for these inputs, or you can import your own.

Specifically, you can choose Geo: **country_polygons**, Data: **data-choro** and Config: **config-choro**. This configuration will provide you with Choropleth layer. In the editors, you have the option to modify the inputs, and at the same time, if you make some changes directly in the map, you can observe that the modified data is written into the editor with the configuration.

You can also use the tool here to search for and download geographic and measured data from the ArcGIS Hub repository.
